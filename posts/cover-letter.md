Dear OpenAI Hiring Team,

I want to help deploy ChatGPT where it matters most; in secure, high-stakes environments where reliability isn't optional.

With 5+ years building AI-powered applications, I've lived at the intersection of infrastructure, security, and user-facing products. At Accenture, I co-led the redesign of a major LLM chat interface using Azure's hybrid/vector search, increasing user engagement by 40%.

I've integrated OpenAI's Agents SDK (tool calling, guardrails, streaming), built MCP server infrastructure, and developed RAG chatbots with custom embeddings pipelines, all while embedded with security and compliance teams navigating complex constraints.

Beyond enterprise work for the Government, I've co-founded an AI agent startup, trained foundation voice models, and authored research paper on safety modules in text-to-video synthesis through Stanford's AI program. These experiences taught me to ship fast in ambiguous environments while keeping users and their data safe.

What excites me about this role: the rare chance to own features end-to-end, work directly with customers, and build capabilities that bring OpenAI's technology to environments that safeguard national and public interests. Ambiguous, cross-functional, mission-critical—that's where I do my best work.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to OpenAI's public sector mission.

Warm regards,

Henry Ebomah
