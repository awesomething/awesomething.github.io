I'm an seasoned software engineer with a versatile history of working on large scale enterprise solutions from frontend to fullstack to AI/ML development. Additionally, I have a strong penchant to build and lead small development teams using my strong problem-solving skills.

Over my 7+ years of tech experience, I have heavily focused my attention on full-stack development and fostering agile practices. More than 4+ of those years I have engaged in building enterprise applications and architecture for the Government, managing complexity in the highly secure systems, quickly creating POC solutions to close Federal clients but delivering future proof and easily scalable production ready applications. The other three years span across open source and startup projects such as been a Cofounder/CTO at ObserveYourFuture - leading a small team of developers to initial product launch and at videobookai - building AI Career Agents. 

Moreover, I have exceptional teaching skills and I try to make a positive impact in underserved communities globally looking to get into tech, with my educational material. I am quite active on Discord and Slack where I have mentored junior developers and taught around 250 learners across different Universities like California State University, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Winsconsin University and more. Recently I completed my Stanford University AI Professional Program where I authored a research paper called ATVDM - Advanced Text-to-Video Diffusion Models: [Learn more here](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/680b7205-4a8c-46e0-9d33-94929ddbca62).

I'm a lifelong learner who has a strong interest in emerging AI technologies and currently tinkering with Agentic AI. Feel free to reach out if you would like to learn more about me or just say hi; I love stumbling across the messages from the strangers in my inbox.
